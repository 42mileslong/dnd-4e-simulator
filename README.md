dnd-4e-simulator
================

A Dungeons and Dragons simulator, with the purpose of decreasing encounter time.
This is by no means a replacement for the board game, or a way to play in a much quicker amount of time. It is meant for a dungeon master to use to keep encounters short and avoid confusion about attack and damage roles.
